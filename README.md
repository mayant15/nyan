# 🐱 nyan

Functional programming utilities for C++ 17, written to help me learn the basics of how FP works.

You can start using nyan right away, just pick the `nyan/nyan.h` file. Everything can be accessed in the `nyan::` namespace. See `tests/` for example usage.

nyan uses [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) for unit tests.
