# üê± nyan

Utilities for programming with categories in C++20.

You can start using nyan right away, just pick the header files in `nyan/`. Everything can be accessed in the `nyan::` namespace. See `tests/` for example usage.

nyan uses [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) for unit tests.
